# RevolutionUC Stats Slack Bot

A slack bot that posts how many registrants we have and a random stat about our particpants each night.
This is to help keep our ourganizers updated on how we are doing on registration numbers and so we can be more aware on what our demographics are.

The bot runs on AWS Lambda using the Serverless framework. The bot is pretty useless if you don't have an API key for our backend but it can be useful to learn how to make a serverless Slack bot.
